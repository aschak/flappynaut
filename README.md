## Physics 
  
  * Flappynaut can collide with asteroids, but not leave the screen, letting the player collide with asteroids at certain 
    angles while staying in play. 
  * Lines of asteroids are generated that approach the player with randomized speeds.
  * Each asteroid is treated a separate collision object, allowing for spectacular collisions with Flappynaut. 
  
## Visuals 
  * Flappynaut animation spritesheet is offset to give the impression of a failing jetpack 
  * Asteroid sprites are randomly chosen as they generate.
